# TVSourceParser

One click to parse `Romanian television sources` followed by creation with Vagrant of a VM that hosts an Acestream server proxy and loads those channels into VLC

It should work with both `Hyper-V` and `Oracle's VirtualBox`; The VirtualBox solution should work on MacOS/Linux although in Linux the native code could be used.

Further: look into building a Linux appliance(Raspberry Pi/Beaglebone) with same purpose.
