Using Vagrant to deploy this image

https://gist.github.com/jbergler/a51db1442ca226cc5973

where I had to modify the vm.box to this https://app.vagrantup.com/johnpbloch/boxes/trusty64 because it wasn't working with hyper-v

`
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "johnpbloch/trusty64"
end
`

I am annoyed as it needs the windows user name/password to install some CIF shares.

Once it's up the vagrant box can play ace-stream-ids in VLC at the following address

http://acelinux:8000/pid/476a37cfc950c919013344150626b42fa6c042eb/stream.mp4

where acelinux is the IP of the box and `476a37cfc950c919013344150626b42fa6c042eb` is the Ace-stream-id


This program is parsing cool-tv.net to obtain the ace-stream-id's of Romanian televisions.
